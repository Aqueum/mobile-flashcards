# Purpose & design

A flashcard app for iPhone X (which will likely also work, but hasn't been tested, on other iOS & Android devices). It allows users to:

* add decks of revision cards,
* add question & answer cards to those decks,
* quiz themselves on the decks
* receive notifications to take a quiz

# Getting Started

1.  fork, clone or download the project from [here](https://github.com/Aqueum/mobile-flashcards)
2.  navigate to the created `mobile-flashcards` folder

5.  follow the Expo instructions to launch the app on your phone or simulator
6.  please note that this has been **developed for and tested on iPhone X only**
